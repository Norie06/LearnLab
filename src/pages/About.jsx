        <p>
          LearnLab is an interactive online platform designed to help students improve their study habits using evidence-based cognitive science techniques. It provides tools for personalized learning strategies, spaced repetition planning, interactive note-taking experiments, and access to cognitive science resourcesâ€”all tailored to enhance academic performance.

          It has become such thanks to the Applied Cognitive Science class at Aarhus University, where the three creators met up and started working on this idea. This is a semester project that has a three-people team working on it.
        </p>
        <h2>Who are the creators?</h2>
        <p>
          There are three of us, all students studying Cognitive Science at Aarhus University, currently in 2nd semester:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Ada</span>, who came up with the idea and focused on the contents of LearnLab.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Katie</span>, who designed the website in Figma and created the lectures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Nora</span>, who is the main developer of this website and has provided feedback.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And, by extent, all of those who participated in fleshing out this project.
        </p>
        <p id='thank_you' className='bold'>
          Thank you all for using this website and creating a wonderful community of students, happy learning!
