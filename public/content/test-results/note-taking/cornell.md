## **You're a Cornell Notes Connoisseur!**  

The Cornell Notes Method is a structured method that divides the page into three sections: cues, notes, and a summary.  
You thrive on organization and benefit from active recall during review.  

### When to Use:  
- For lectures or meetings where you need to capture detailed information.  
- When reviewing material for exams (use the cue column to quiz yourself).  

**Pro Tip**: After class, write a brief summary at the bottom of the page to reinforce key points.
