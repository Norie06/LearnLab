## **You're an Outline Expert!**  

The Outline Method is a hierarchical note-taking technique that uses bullet points and subpoints to organize information logically.  
You prefer clear, structured notes that are easy to review.  

### When to Use:  
- For lectures or readings with a lot of detail.  
- When you need to create a clear, step-by-step plan (e.g., essays, projects).  

**Pro Tip:** Use indentation and numbering to show relationships between ideas.
