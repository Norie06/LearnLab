# Dual Process Theory

Dual Process Theory suggests that the brain uses two systems for thinking:  



* **System 1:** Fast, automatic, and intuitive (e.g., recognizing faces).  
* **System 2:** Slow, deliberate, and analytical (e.g., solving math problems).  

**Why It Matters:** Understanding these systems helps optimize learning strategies.  

**How to Apply:** 



* Use System 1 for familiar tasks (e.g., flashcards for vocabulary).  
* Engage System 2 for complex problem-solving (e.g., breaking down calculus problems).
