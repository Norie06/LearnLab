# **Neuroplasticity**  

Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections.

**Why It Matters:** It proves that learning and skill development are possible at any age.

**How to Apply:**



* Engage in deliberate practice to strengthen neural pathways.  
* Learn new skills (e.g., a language or instrument) to challenge the brain.  
* Use spaced repetition to reinforce learning over time.
