# Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)

Cognitive Load Theory explains how the brain processes and retains information, emphasizing the importance of managing mental effort.  

**Why It Matters:** Overloading working memory reduces learning efficiency, while optimizing cognitive load enhances retention.  

**Types of Cognitive Load:** 



* **Intrinsic:** Complexity of the material (e.g., calculus vs. basic arithmetic).  
* **Extraneous:** Unnecessary mental effort caused by poor design (e.g., cluttered slides).  
* **Germane:** Effort devoted to creating mental schemas (e.g., connecting new info to prior knowledge).  

**How to Apply:**  



* Simplify complex topics with visuals and analogies.  
* Use clear, structured layouts in study materials.  
* Avoid multitasking to reduce extraneous load.
