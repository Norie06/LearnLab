# The Testing Effect  

The testing effect refers to the phenomenon where retrieving information from memory enhances long-term retention. 

**Why It Matters:** Testing yourself is more effective than passive review methods like re-reading.

**How to Apply:**



* Take frequent practice tests on studied material.  
* Use flashcards for active recall.  
* Turn notes into question-and-answer formats.
