# Schema Theory  

Schemas are mental frameworks that help organize and interpret information.  

**Why It Matters:** Building schemas allows learners to connect new information to existing knowledge, improving comprehension and recall.  

**How to Apply:**



* Use mind maps to visually organize concepts and relationships.  
* Group related information into categories (e.g., types of chemical reactions).  
* Relate new material to real-world examples or personal experiences.
