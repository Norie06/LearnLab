# Metacognition & Self-Regulated Learning

Metacognition is the awareness of one's own learning process. Self-regulated learning involves setting goals, monitoring progress, and adjusting strategies.

## Why It Works

Reflecting on learning helps identify strengths and weaknesses, leading to more effective study habits.

## How to Apply:
- Set specific, measurable goals for each study session
- Use reflection journals to track progress
- Adjust study methods based on performance feedback
