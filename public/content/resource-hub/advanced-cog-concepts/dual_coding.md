# Dual Coding Theory

Dual coding theory suggests that combining verbal and visual information enhances learning by engaging multiple cognitive pathways.

## Why It Works

The brain processes visual and verbal information separately but simultaneously, creating stronger and more interconnected memories.

## How to Apply:
- Pair text with diagrams, charts, or infographics.
- Use sketchnotes to combine drawings and written explanations.
- Watch videos with subtitles to engage both auditory and visual channels.
