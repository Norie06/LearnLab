# Metacognition & Self-Regulated Learning

Metacognition is the awareness of one’s own learning process, while self-regulated learning involves setting goals, monitoring progress, and adjusting strategies.  

**Why It Matters:** Learners who reflect on their progress and adapt their strategies perform better academically.  

**How to Apply:**



* Set specific, measurable goals for each study session.  
* Use reflection journals to track progress and identify areas for improvement.  
* Adjust study methods based on performance feedback.  

**Useful Tools:** 



* **Notion** ([Notion](https://www.notion.so)):  
    * Creates a self-assessment journal or progress dashboard.  
    * **How to Use:** Track study hours, quiz scores, and retention rates.  
* **Reflectly** ([Reflectly](https://www.reflectly.app)):  
    * Daily reflection app with prompts for self-assessment.
