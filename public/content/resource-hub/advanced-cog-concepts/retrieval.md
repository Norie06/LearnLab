# Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice is the act of recalling information from memory, which strengthens neural connections and improves long-term retention.

## Why It Works

When you actively retrieve information, you reinforce the memory pathways, making it easier to recall later. This is far more effective than passive review methods like re-reading or highlighting.

## How to Apply:
- Use flashcards to test yourself on key concepts
- Take practice tests under exam conditions
- Explain concepts in your own words (Feynman Technique)
