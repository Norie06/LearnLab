# Interleaving Practice

Interleaving involves mixing different topics or types of problems within a single study session.

## Why It Works

Interleaving forces the brain to constantly adapt, improving problem-solving skills and long-term retention.

## How to Apply:
- Alternate between subjects (e.g., math and science) during study sessions
- Mix different types of problems (e.g., algebra and geometry)
- Use flashcards with interleaved topics

## Useful Tools:
- **Miro** ([Miro](https://miro.com)):
  - Mind-mapping tool for mixing topics
  - **How to Use:** Create interleaved study sessions (e.g., algebra + geometry problems)
