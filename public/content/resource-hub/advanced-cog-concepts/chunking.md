# Chunking

Chunking involves breaking down complex information into smaller, manageable units (chunks) to improve memory and understanding.

## Why It Works

The brain can only hold a limited amount of information in working memory at once. Chunking reduces cognitive load and makes it easier to process and recall information.

## How to Apply:
- Break long numbers into smaller groups (e.g., phone numbers).
- Organize study material into categories or themes.
- Use acronyms or mnemonics to remember lists.

## Useful Tools:
