# Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and abilities can be developed through effort and practice.  

**Why It Matters** Embracing challenges and learning from failures fosters resilience and long-term success.  

**How to Apply:**



* Replace “I can’t do this” with “I haven’t mastered this yet.”  
* Celebrate small wins and progress.  
* Seek feedback and learn from mistakes.  

**Useful Tools:** 



* **Habitica** ([Habitica](https://habitica.com)): Gamify learning goals and track progress.  
* **Trello** ([Trello](https://trello.com)): Create a “Progress Celebration” board.
