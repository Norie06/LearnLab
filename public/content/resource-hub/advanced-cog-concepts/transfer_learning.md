# Transfer of Learning

Transfer of learning refers to applying knowledge or skills learned in one context to another. 

**Why It Matters:** Effective transfer ensures that learning is not confined to a single task or subject but can be generalized to new situations.  

**Types of Transfer:**



* **Near Transfer:** Applying knowledge to similar contexts (e.g., solving similar math problems).  
* **Far Transfer:** Applying knowledge to dissimilar contexts (e.g., using physics principles in engineering).  

**How to Apply:**



* Practice solving problems in varied contexts.  
* Use analogies to connect concepts across subjects.  
* Reflect on how skills learned in one area can apply to another.
