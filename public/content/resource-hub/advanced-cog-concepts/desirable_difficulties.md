# Desirable Difficulties

Desirable difficulties are challenging learning conditions that enhance long-term retention.  

**Why It Matters:** Struggling with material during learning leads to better recall later.  

**Examples:**



* Spaced repetition (vs. cramming).  
* Retrieval practice (vs. passive review).  
* Interleaving (vs. blocked practice).  

**How to Apply:**  



* Space out study sessions instead of cramming.  
* Test yourself frequently on material.  
* Mix different topics or problem types during practice.
