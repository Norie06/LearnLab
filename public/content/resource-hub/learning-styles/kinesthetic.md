* Apply **role-playing or teaching others** to enhance understanding.
* Use **interactive tools like flashcards with actions** (e.g., sorting cards physically).

* Study in **short bursts with active breaks**, rather than long passive sessions.
* Incorporate **learning games, puzzles, or building models** into your study routine.
* Act out historical events, **perform experiments**, or build prototypes for science topics.
* Work at a **standing desk or use stress balls** while reviewing material.
* **Write concepts on a whiteboard** and physically interact with them.
