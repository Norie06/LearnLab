# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition involves reviewing material at increasing intervals over time to combat the forgetting curve.

## Why It Works

The brain forgets information rapidly unless it is revisited. Spaced repetition ensures that information is reinforced just as it begins to fade, leading to stronger retention.

## How to Apply:
- Start with short intervals (1 day, 3 days) and gradually increase them (1 week, 1 month)
- Focus on weaker areas during review sessions
- Combine with active recall for maximum effectiveness

## Useful Tools:
- **Anki** ([AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net)):
  - Automatically schedules flashcards using the SM-2 algorithm
  - **How to Use:** Create decks for each subject and review cards daily
- **RemNote** ([RemNote](https://www.remnote.com)):
  - Combines spaced repetition with note-taking
  - **How to Use:** Highlight key points in your notes and turn them into flashcards
- **LearnLab Scheduler** (Custom Tool Idea):
  - Input topics/deadlines â†’ auto-generates a review calendar
  - **How to Use:** Sync with Google Calendar or set email reminders for reviews
