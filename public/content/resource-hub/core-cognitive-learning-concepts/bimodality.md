# Bimodality in Learning

Bimodality refers to combining two sensory modalities (e.g., visual + auditory) to enhance learning.

## Why It Works:
Engaging multiple senses creates richer, more interconnected memories. For example, watching a video (visual + auditory) is often more effective than reading text alone.

## How to Apply:
- Watch educational videos with subtitles.
- Pair podcasts with visual summaries or transcripts.
- Use apps that combine text, images, and audio (e.g., Khan Academy).

## Useful Tools:
- **Khan Academy** ([Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)):
  - Videos + practice exercises for bimodal learning.
  - **How to Use:** Pair videos with handwritten notes or diagrams.
- **Edpuzzle** ([Edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com)):
  - Adds quizzes to YouTube videos.
  - **How to Use:** Test your comprehension after watching videos.
- **Google Jamboard** ([Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com)):
  - Collaborative whiteboard for group study.
  - **How to Use:** Brainstorm ideas or solve problems together.
