# Elaborative Interrogation

Elaborative interrogation involves asking "why" questions to deepen understanding and connect new information to prior knowledge.

## Why It Works

Explaining concepts in detail forces active engagement and strengthens logical reasoning.

## How to Apply:
- After reading a concept, ask: "Why is this true?"
- Relate new material to real-world examples or personal experiences.
- Write explanations in your own words.
